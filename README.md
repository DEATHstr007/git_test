## **Slide 15: AI/ML in Risk Management**

---

### **Proactive, Data-Driven Risk Management**

- **Real-Time Risk Identification**
  - AI/ML algorithms analyze vast, dynamic data sets to detect emerging risks—including market volatility, credit events, and operational threats—faster and more accurately than traditional methods[2][4][7].
  - Machine learning models continuously adapt, learning from new data and evolving risk patterns[4][6].

- **Enhanced Credit & Market Risk Modeling**
  - AI improves credit risk assessment (e.g., predicting defaults, loss given default) using advanced models and richer data segmentation[2][6].
  - Deep learning and nonparametric ML models outperform traditional benchmarks in predicting credit events and managing complex instruments like credit default swaps[6].

- **Operational & Compliance Risk**
  - AI automates monitoring for regulatory compliance, fraud, and cyber threats, reducing manual errors and enabling real-time alerts[2][3][4].
  - Example: Banks using AI report up to **45% reduction in fraudulent transactions** and **20% improvement in compliance efficiency**[7].

- **Transparency & Adaptability**
  - AI systems can provide explainable, auditable decisions to meet regulatory scrutiny and adapt to new risk types as the landscape evolves[2][3][4][8].
